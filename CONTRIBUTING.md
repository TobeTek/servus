This project also makes use of [`pre-commit`]() to ensure code quality. Install `pre-commit` hooks using

```bash

```

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When making a pull request, adhere to the following
guidelines:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't say much about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Explains the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows the action you have taken to solve it.
