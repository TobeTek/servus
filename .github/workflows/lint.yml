# GitHub Action Workflow enforcing our code style and quality.

name: Lint & Tests

# Trigger the workflow on push any branch

# Brand new concurrency setting! This ensures that not more than one run can be triggered for the same commit.
# It is useful for pull requests coming from the main repository since both triggers will match.
